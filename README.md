## Introduction
This project aims to detect semantic similarity between Quora questions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to determine whether pairs of questions are asking the same thing, even if they are phrased differently. This README file provides an overview of the project, including setup instructions, usage, and methodology.
## Features
Preprocessing of text data (tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
Vectorization of text data using TF-IDF and word embeddings
Model training using various machine learning algorithms
Evaluation of model performance
Visualization of results
## Requirements
Python 3.7+
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
NLTK
TensorFlow / Keras (optional for deep learning models)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Removal of stopwords
Tokenization
Stemming/Lemmatization
Vectorization using TF-IDF and word embeddings
Model Training:

Use of various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and deep learning models like LSTM.
Cross-validation to tune hyperparameters
Model Evaluation:

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall
Confusion matrix and ROC curve for visualization
## Model
This project implements several models, including:

Logistic Regression
